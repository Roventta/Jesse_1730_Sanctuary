## Comment and Suggestions

This file documents the comment and suggestions towards Jesse's reflection on her ENGN1211's project

### the System Engineering Process

Its subchapter "Interpret Meaning" requires more buzzwords from the lecture or its slides, especially terminologies from the design process. You have to mention that the process of "debugging" is a practice of the system engineering process, in particular, you should write something like:

> The first design we came up with for the robot to read the surrounding area is  "sweeping", it reads every angle surrounding it, however, under our **Verification stage**, we found that this design < analys limitation herer > by using < debugging methods >. Thus, we hop back to the **design** stage to refine the algorithm   

You should add one paragraph in "identify and describe" about the custome class "WallInfo" you wrote.

In "Planning future", I recommend you swap your paragraph about the future project to the acknoledgement of the "object oriented progrmming", please emphasis on its advantages like, easy-to-read, code reusement, and encapsulazation. In the paragraph of C++, you have to say that while you were reading about OOP, you glared about C++'s power, and all those fancy objects built in C++ stand library, openning up your interest towards it.
